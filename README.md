##JOBuddy
This is a development version of an application for your job hunt. JOBuddy enables users to sign up, access a job post feed from their city and start a new application task to that job. Users can view their applications, update application status and add application specific or general tasks.

JOBuddy aims to help users manage their job hunt and keep track of all the applications they send and events and deadlines they do not want to miss.

Can be viewed live at Heroku, newest version coming soon!
