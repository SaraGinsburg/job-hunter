## JOBuddy
JOBuddy enables users to sign up, access a Stackoverflow job post feed from their city and start a new application task to that job. Users can view their applications, update application status and add application specific or general tasks.

JOBuddy aims to help users manage their job hunt and keep track of all the applications they send and events and deadlines they do not want to miss.
